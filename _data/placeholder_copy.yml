# Some default placeholder copy
staff_template: "<p>Welcome to your shiny new email template! Here are a few important, general things to remember when creating your email:</p><ol><li><strong>Do not copy/paste from a Word Doc</strong>. It brings in unwanted formatting and make things look strange. Either type directly into this template, or into TextEdit (Mac) or NotePad (PC), remove formatting, then paste here.</li><li><strong>Use the WYSIWYG</strong> (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) editor above to add formatting (bold, italics, heading styles, links, etc.). I'd be happy to help if need be.</li></ol><p>And before sending:</p><ol><li><strong>Check the date</strong> above!</li><li><strong>Send a test email</strong> to yourself and Sandy Harris (sharris@fbctn.org)</strong>.</li><li><strong>Make sure everything looks good</strong> and styles are uniform.</li></ol><p>If anything breaks or if you need something fancier added, we can do that for you. Just email Sandy Harris (<a href='mailto:sharris@fbctn.org?subject=Help with email template!' title='Email Sandy Harris'>sharris@fbctn.org</a>) to create a job and we'll get it to you as soon as we can.</p>"
