						<h5>Dear Fellowship Adoptive &amp; Foster Families,</h5>
						<p>As we celebrate 20 years of ministry here at Fellowship Bible Church, we look back with gratitude, at the ways in which God has richly blessed the people and the mission of this community of believers. We’re excited about where God is moving in this new season of “renewal” as we dream and pray for the days ahead.</p>
						<p>We’re equally excited for a season of renewal in our Adoption, Foster and Orphan Care ministry, as we move with intentionality toward new opportunities to support, mentor and connect those who are embracing God’s heart for the orphan. We invite you to join us as we journey.</p>
						<h4>Ministry Vision Meetings</h4>
						<p>Would you consider helping us dream about new ways our ministry can serve, connect and grow adoptive and fostering families in our church body and in our city? We will gather to discuss potential new class offerings, group opportunities and more. So, mark your calendar for one of the following meetings. Childcare will be available at the Brentwood campus for your children (birth - 6<sup>th</sup> Grade).</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Sunday, Oct. 22<sup>nd</sup>, 9:35am, Learning Center, Room 250</li>
							<li>Sunday, Oct. 29<sup>th</sup>, 11:10am, Learning Center, Room 250</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Please RSVP to Connie Dunlop (<a href="mailto:cdunlop@fbctn.org">cdunlop@fbctn.org</a>) and let us know which meeting time you can attend.</p>
						<h4>Soul-Care Therapeutic Seminar</h4>
						<p>The Soul-Care Curriculum is a Christian-based, results-oriented curriculum that trains adoptive and foster parents to use tangible, concrete methods that will equip children/teens/young adults to create healthy, emotional attachments. The next Soul-Care seminar will be held on Saturday, Nov. 11<sup>th</sup> at Clearview Baptist Church (off Franklin Road). To learn more or to register, visit <a href="http://hopehouseinternational.org/soul-care-registration">hopehouseinternational.org</a>.</p>
						<h4>Adoption &amp; Orphan Picnic, Sunday, November 12<sup>th</sup></h4>
						<p>We will celebrate National Orphan Sunday with our annual picnic at the Brentwood campus (The Barn) from 12:15-2:00pm. We’ll spend time connecting as a church-adoption community, communicating adoption and foster care news, and share a meal. Lunch will be provided by Fellowship, so bring your family and join us as we celebrate the goodness of the Lord through adoption. If you have friends who are interested in adoption or foster care, please invite them to attend as well. No registration required.</p>
						<h4>Tennessee Alliance for Kids</h4>
						<p>Did you know that Fellowship helped launch a non-profit? Tennessee Alliance for Kids (TAK) serves as a liaison between the faith-based community and the State of Tennessee with the goal of meeting the immediate needs of children and youth currently in or aging out of foster care. Since its inception, just over a year ago, TAK has received over 75 requests representing 190 kids, kept 27 children in their homes and saved the state of TN over $727,000! Through the <strong>#FOSTERLOVE</strong> Coalition, needs of children at risk of coming into foster care, those in care, or those aging out of care are shared with individuals, churches, and businesses through email and social media. TAK then works to ensure that donors are matched to meet the needs. To learn more about TAK, visit <a href="http://tnallianceforkids.org">tnallianceforkids.org</a>. Making a difference for a child in foster care is easy… simply like us on Facebook at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TNAllianceForKids/">TNAllianceForKids</a> today!</p>
						<h4>Foster Carols</h4>
						<p>Tennessee Alliance for Kids (TAK) will host their first annual fund-raising event, <em>Foster Carols</em>, on Thursday, Nov. 30<sup>th</sup>, 6:30pm at Sycamore Farms (Barn). This will be an evening of dinner, music and merriment designed to highlight some aspiring young vocalists from Tennessee’s foster care system. We pray this will be a life-changing event for these kids and benefit many others currently in or aging out of the foster care system. If interested in attending this event along with others from Fellowship, please email Connie Dunlop (<a href="mailto:cdunlop@fbctn.org">cdunlop@fbctn.org</a>). Details and ticket information online at <a href="http://tnallianceforkids.org">tnallianceforkids.org</a>.</p>
						<h4>Re | Engage Marriage Ministry</h4>
						<p>Re | Engage is a marriage enrichment program that examines God’s design for marriage and applies biblical principles to guide couples towards growth in their relationship. Re | Engage offers hope to marriages by helping couples move toward oneness through stories of grace, teaching and small groups. Beginning in January, this 16-week experience will meet at Fellowship (Brentwood campus). If interested in this joining this class with other adoptive/fostering couples, please email Connie Dunlop (<a href="mailto:cdunlop@fbctn.org">cdunlop@fbctn.org</a>).</p>
						<h4>Empowered to Connect Conference 2018</h4>
						<p>Save the date! We will host a simulcast of the Empowered to Connect Conference at Fellowship (Brentwood campus) on Friday, April 13<sup>th</sup> and Saturday, April 14<sup>th</sup>. This is a two-day conference will feature practical teaching in a safe and supportive community to help equip families, churches, and professionals to better serve children impacted by adoption and foster care. To learn more, visit <a href="http://empoweredtoconnect.org">empoweredtoconnect.org</a>. More details and registration coming in January 2018.</p>
						<h4>Welcome Connie Dunlop!</h4>
						<p>Connie Dunlop and her family have called Fellowship home for the past 15 years. Most recently Connie served as our Fellowship Kids Director at our Franklin campus. Connie will be supporting our Adoption, Foster and Orphan Care ministry as our Coordinator for the next year as we pray and dream for how God desires to build this ministry.</p>
						<p>Grateful to journey with you,</p>
