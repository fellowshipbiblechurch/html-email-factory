						<h5>Fellowship Women,</h5>
            <p>When I think of summer as a kid, I remember side-stepping a daddy-long-leg to pick rhubarb right from the garden. I remember running through the water sprinkler with friends and riding our bikes around our block. Summer also makes me think of eating ice cream sandwiches with my brother at the beach, attempting to ride skateboards, and going to movies with my dad.</p>
            <p>What comes to mind when you think of summer?</p>
            <p>Maybe baseball games? A trip to the beach? A mission trip? Pool time with the kids or maybe going to the lake with friends? Most of us long for a little fun over the summer&mdash;whether it’s international travel, roller coasters, catching fireflies or making s’mores.</p>
            <p>Whatever you end up doing, Fellowship Women is providing the opportunity to fill your summer with truth, meaningful love, and quality conversations. Our summer study, <a href="http://www.fellowshipbiblechurch.org/event/955671-2017-06-06-truthtuesday" title="#truthtuesday">#truthtuesday</a>, is all about the truth of God’s character. Our two book titles for our Summer Book Club address love: <a href="http://www.fellowshipbiblechurch.org/event/958640-2017-06-14-summer-book-club" title="June Summer Book Club - A Walk Across the Sun by Corban Addison">one in the midst of human trafficking</a> and <a href="http://www.fellowshipbiblechurch.org/event/958638-2017-07-12-summer-book-club" title="July Summer Book Club - Love Lives Here by Maria Goff">the other in everyday life</a>. Also, our <a href="http://www.fellowshipbiblechurch.org/event/914547-2017-06-23-friday-night-four-questions" title="Friday Night | Four Questions">Friday Night | Four Questions</a> will invite you into a conversation about expectations.</p>
            <p>These opportunities all take place in the evening, so whether you are a young professional hoping to find a place to connect or a mom longing for adult conversation or a mature believer looking for rich biblical community, Fellowship Women is the place for you!</p>
            <p>We’d love to be a part of your summer!</p>
