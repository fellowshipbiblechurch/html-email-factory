						<h5>FSM Family,</h5>
						<p>I wanted to introduce you to our newest staff member. Last spring, I began a search for someone to lead our Jr. High ministry. In God’s timing and provision, I came across Monty Spurgeon through our many connections with Pine Cove Camps (Tyler, Texas). Monty was serving as their men’s director at Timbers Camp&mdash;focuses on 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> graders. He and his family are now in Nashville and I could not be more excited for the type of leadership our Jr. High students are about to experience. We introduced Monty to parents at Ice Cream Olympics a few weeks ago and will be introducing him in the weekend services on Sept. 30<sup>th</sup> and Oct. 1<sup>st</sup>! If you are able to attend, please take a moment and introduce yourself and meet his sweet wife and baby girl. Below is a brief note from Monty:</p>
						<div class="blockquote">Hello, There! I am so excited to be the new Mix Pastor. My family and I are thankful for this opportunity to invest in your students. We love working with Jr. High and know it is such a critical time in life. It is during these years they decide how to deal with their joys, failures, insecurities, hurts, and identity. They learn to either run to the world or run to Jesus. It is my prayer that as we partner together that we may point them to God's Word and remind them of the hope they have in Christ. Looking forward to this next year and cannot wait to meet you!</div>
						<p>Monty’s role will be primarily focused on serving our 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> grade students in The Mix and taking a lead role with our FSM camps. He is our “go to” for vision and direction of the Jr. High ministry and leading our Mix volunteers. If you are unable to meet him later this month, please drop into The Mix on a Wednesday night in the next weeks and introduce yourself. The FSM team is stronger than ever and excited about all that God is up to this new school year.</p>
