						<h5>Dear Brentwood Congregation,</h5>
						<p>Below is a letter, the essence of which was shared with our Saturday night congregation and the three Sunday services this past weekend.</p>
						<p>
						<div class="blockquote">
							<h5>Dear Fellowship Family,</h5>
							<p>Our season of renewal is well underway. New elders are being vetted, our study of Acts is challenging us with a clear picture of the mission, vision, and values of the church as Christ intended, and over 2,000 of us have joined together to pray and fast over the course of 40 days.</p>
							<p>Renewal also means evaluation, and your staff leadership, lay leaders, and elders have been evaluating ministries across the board.</p>
							<p>Just over ten years ago, we launched our Saturday night worship services for the purpose of making seats available at opportune times on Sundays. At that time, all three Sunday worship services were at or above 80% capacity.</p>
							<p>Today, we have significant space available at our 8:00 and 11:10 services. In addition, the Sunday 9:35 service has limited space. The Saturday night service has gradually declined each year over the past seven years and is down almost 70% in attendance. This is due to a number of factors including the launch of two additional congregations, unexpected church challenges, a lack of mission/vision clarity, and leadership transitions here at Brentwood.</p>
							<p>What our Saturday night service is telling us is that it has fulfilled its purpose. In light of this, we will end our Saturday night worship service on Saturday, December 16<sup>th</sup>.</p>
							<p>Limited resources, growing needs in other ministry areas, a significant drop in Saturday attendance, and available seats on Sunday at our Brentwood, Franklin, and Nashville campuses all combine to make this decision the wise and reasonable course of action.</p>
							<p>In this process, we will do everything we can to help you transition to Sunday morning services at the Brentwood campus, another Fellowship campus, or to find another church in the community with a service time that fits your schedule.</p>
							<p>We want you to know that our Teaching, Worship &amp; Arts, Tech, Security, Welcome and Fellowship Kids teams will all be fully staffed through Saturday, December 16<sup>th</sup>, so we encourage you to continuing attending on Saturday nights until that date.</p>
							<p>Between now and then, we have staff available to answer questions and help you make this transition:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>For Adults</strong> - Our Connections Pastor, Mark Holeman, is available to help you transition to Sunday services. If you desire, Mark can also help you get connected with a group, class or team. Email Mark to learn more (<a href="mailto:mholeman@fbctn.org">mholeman@fbctn.org</a>).</li>
								<li><strong>For Families with children in Fellowship Kids</strong> - Lauren Young, our Fellowship Kids Guest Coordinator, is available to help get your kids into the appropriate Sunday classes. Please contact Lauren (<a href="mailto:lyoung@fbctn.org">lyoung@fbctn.org</a>) for assistance.</li>
								<li><strong>For Fellowship Kids Volunteers</strong> - To find the right class for you to get plugged in on Sundays, contact your Fellowship Kids Coordinator.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>We want each of you to feel free to choose the service that best suits your needs. For those of you who have some flexibility, may we encourage you to consider coming at either 8:00am or 11:10am? These two services have the most space available.</p>
							<p>It has been a fruitful 10-year run. Thank you for choosing to make room for others, for serving in so many ways over the years, and even now for choosing what is best for the whole.</p>
							<p>All for His glory,</p>
							<h5 class="u-flush--b">Your Fellowship Leadership Team</h5>
						</div>
						<p>Please make this transition a matter of prayer during our <em>40 Days of Prayer and Fasting</em>&mdash;not just for the Saturday night congregation, but for all of us as we continue to evaluate where we are and seek the Lordâ€™s direction for our church.</p>
						<p class="u-flush--b">Proclaiming Christ, maturing in the faith and giving our lives away with you,</p>
