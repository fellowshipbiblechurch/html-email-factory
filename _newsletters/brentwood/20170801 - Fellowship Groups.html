						<h5>Friends,</h5>
						<p>On March 15<sup>th</sup>, 2017, I pulled into the entrance of Fellowship Bible Church as the new Fellowship Groups Director. My wife and I moved here from Knoxville with a strong passion for small groups and raising up small group leaders. Not knowing anyone at Fellowship, I have spent the past four months getting to know my team, our elders, our staff, some group leaders (not all yet), our church body, and trying to identify leaders who are passionate about groups as well. One of the most valuable things I’ve learned is the rich history of community and groups at Fellowship. We have groups that have been together for over ten years and some that just launched a year ago. Fellowship Groups exist <strong><em>to help people connect and follow Jesus together</em></strong>. In order to follow Jesus fully, we have to connect relationally. We want to provide space for people to do just that. Having been born and raised in the beautiful town of Brentwood, I can confidently say that it is a joy to be back home.</p>

						<h4>Fall 2017</h4>
						<p>As fall quickly approaches, there are a few things that I would love to make you aware of as it pertains to Fellowship Groups.</p>
						<p>First, our fall connection season will take place in August and September. <em>Fellowship Together</em>, our four-week connection campaign is where you will begin to see the return of our on-campus <em>Connect Points</em>. These are physical, visible points where people can approach a staff member or volunteer and get connected via group, class, or team. As group leaders, please point people interested in Fellowship Groups to our Connect Points.</p>
						<p>Second, our Fellowship Group Event will be on Sunday, Sept. 10<sup>th</sup>, 4:00-5:30pm in the Worship Center. Going into the fall, if you know that your group will have “people space” and you have room to add up to four (4) people to your group, please email me to confirm that. We can add those people via the Group Event or Group Finder online. Also, if you know of someone inside or outside of your group who would be a good potential group leader, please email me their info. I would love to talk to them!</p>
						<p>This is an exciting season for Fellowship as we quickly approach our 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary next spring. Leader identification, leader development, and leader community are priority for me in this season and in the next year. I am excited to build upon what has been established in the last year and bring energy and passion to groups.</p>
						<p>I consider it a gift to be at Fellowship directing Fellowship Groups. I also consider YOU a gift to our ministry. Your commitment to create environments where people can connect to each other and follow Jesus together is noticed! I am excited to partner with you now and in the seasons to come.</p>
						<p>We are better together!</p>
