						<h5>Dear Group Leader,</h5>
						<p>Happy October! I hope this newsletter finds you doing well. As our fall connection season comes to a close, I wanted to celebrate what God has done and is doing here at Fellowship.</p>
						<h4>Fall Group Event</h4>
						<p>We had an amazing Fall Group Event on Sept. 10<sup>th</sup>. The Barn was filled with people looking to connect, meet group leaders, and select a group. I am happy to report that around 80 people have connected to a group either through the Group Event or Group Finder.</p>
						<p>We have eight <em>new</em> Fellowship Groups that are launching this fall. As we continue to build leader community at Fellowship, I want you to know who you are leading alongside of. Below are the names of our <em>new</em> Fellowship Group Leaders for Fall 2017 and a text message that I received from one of them about their first group gathering. I hope it blesses you as much as it blessed me!</p>
						<div class="blockquote">
							<p>We just had our first group dinner and it was AMAZING!!! Such an answered prayer for us and our group members. There was beautiful fellowship and such an exciting foundation laid. We also had the opportunity to pray over a Newk’s employee who sat down with us. That was really awesome!</p>
							<p class="u-flush--b"><strong>Tyler &amp; Emily Leuck</strong></p>
						</div>
						<h4>Our New Fellowship Group Leaders</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Tyler &amp; Emily Leuck</li>
							<li>Tyler &amp; Sherry Merideth</li>
							<li>Jared &amp; Somerlie DePasquale</li>
							<li>Will &amp; Abbie Heydel</li>
							<li>Matt &amp; Melissa Toy</li>
							<li>Jeremy &amp; Brynn Crady</li>
							<li>Preston &amp; Carly Walls &amp; Ryan &amp; Sara McCarthy</li>
							<li>Josh &amp; Nikke Ryner &amp; Andrew &amp; Kelli Porter</li>
						</ul>
						<p>That is what it is all about folks! We are <em>helping people connect with each other and follow Jesus</em>. Join me in praying for these new leaders by name, their groups, and the journey that lies ahead as they seek to build community with each other. I believe in these people!</p>
						<h4>Harvey Relief Trip - Oct. 18<sup>th</sup>-22<sup>nd</sup></h4>
						<p>Fellowship is sending a disaster relief team to partner with First Baptist Church in Beaumont, Texas in providing on-the-ground relief help to areas in the community impacted by flooding from Hurricane Harvey. The team will depart from Fellowship Brentwood early Wednesday, October 18<sup>th</sup>, in a 15-passenger van and drive 12 hours down to Beaumont. They will have three solid days of work and will drive back to Nashville on Sunday, October 22<sup>nd</sup>.

						<h4>An Exciting Season</h4>
						<p>This is an exciting season at Fellowship Bible Church as we look to God to give us vision for the next season as a church. I pray, as group leaders, we would champion Fellowship’s efforts in helping people connect here and would be able to identify future group leaders who would be willing to create an environment where people can connect with each other and follow Jesus in groups.</p>
						<p>I am thankful for you,</p>
