						<h5>Dear Fellowship Leaders,</h5>
						<p>We had a great time gathering as a family of staff and leadership this past Sunday. Again, we want to say how grateful we are for the way each of you serve at Fellowship. For those of you who were unable to attend, check out the video below to find out what you missed.</p>
						<p>[Link for event video]</p>
						<p>We shared at the event that the <a href="discipleship.org"><strong>2017 National Disciple Making Forum</strong></a> is coming to Nashville in November. In fact, this awesome event is going to be hosted just across the parking lot, at Brentwood Baptist, on November 9<sup>th</sup> and 10t<sup>h</sup>. We’d love to cover your registration cost if you would like to attend. All you need to do is click the link below to register and we’ll take care of getting your ticket.</p>
						<p>[Link for conference registration – going to make an event in F1]</p>
						<p>As we’ll be discussing throughout our study of Acts this fall, the church is God’s “Plan A” for the world. Who else will bring the light and life of Christ to the people who need it most? This season is an important and exciting time of “RENEWAL” for our part of Christ’s body. THANK YOU for serving and leading. It really does matter!</p>
						<p>Sincerely,</p>
