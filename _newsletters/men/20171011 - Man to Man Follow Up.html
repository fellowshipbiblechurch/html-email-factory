						<h5>Fellowship Men,</h5>
						<p>While sitting at our most recent Man To Man event last Thursday morning, my soul was stirred for you&mdash;the men of Fellowship. You are good men who honor God, love your families, and engage your work well. You carry this weight while surrounded by voices and systems that are set up for your failure. There is so much at stake.</p>
						<p>If you missed the last week’s event, I can’t urge you strongly enough to listen to Nate Larkin’s story about finding hope and life through his struggle with sexual addiction. Every man owes it to themselves, their families, and those they care about to engage this issue and begin asking the Spirit to breathe new life into this part of our journeys. You can find the audio link here:</p>

						<p>One of the things Nate shared is that “Jesus doesn’t have any solo disciples.” We can’t walk alone. We want to create opportunities for men to experience community that cares for them where they are and urges them forward. You’ll hear more about this at our next Man To Man event on Thursday evening, November 16<sup>th</sup>. I’ll be sharing my story that evening. I look forward to being with you. You can register <a href="http://www.fellowshipbiblechurch.org/brentwood/event/2017-11-16-man-to-man?utm_source=f1&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign={{ page.title }}&utm_content=body-link" title="Man to Man - November 16th">here</a>.</p>
						<p>Lastly, if Nate’s story sounds familiar to your own struggle, <em>don’t keep it to yourself</em>. If you’re in community with other men, start helping each other. I’d encourage you to take a courageous step and check out the ministry Nate founded, <a href="https://www.samsonsociety.com/" title="Samson Society">Samson Society</a> or reach out to any of our pastors so that we can help you in your journey.</p>
						<p>See you November 16<sup>th</sup>!</p>
