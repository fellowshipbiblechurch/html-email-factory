						<h5>Fellowship Parents,</h5>
						<p>I love this quote from my friend, Brian Housman “Technology changes faster than a middle school girl’s fashion choices…” I also love that he will be at Fellowship speaking at our Parent Summit on Sat., Sept. 23<sup>rd</sup>. Technology continues to be one of the biggest tensions we face, as parents, when it comes to how we lead and guard our kids.</p>
						<p>I remember when our oldest got her first smart phone. For her, it felt like emancipation from the shackles of a perceived disconnected existence to one of immersion into a constant, albeit incomplete, sense of community (she still reminds us that she was the last of her friends to get a phone…). For us it was an immersion of another kind, into a world of easier connectivity with our daughter, but also one of new possibilities and fears that came with that. We didn’t know what we were doing, and we learned by trial and error. We could’ve used an event such as this one!</p>
						<p>That’s why we are launching our Parent Summits&mdash;to help equip you to lead at home as you grow in discipling your children. You got this! You can do this, and we can help you along the journey.</p>
						<p>Brian’s “Tech Savvy Parenting” will be a huge help, no matter what stage you are in as a parent. If your kids are already immersed in this new frontier of technology, you will gain great information and principles that will help you form a plan to enjoy, and not fear, the gift of technology. If you have smaller children who are not there yet, what you’ll learn will help you get ahead of the curve, with principles that will help you develop a plan for that future day when technology comes knocking on your door.</p>
						<p>I really hope you will join me for this incredible event! If you can give us your Saturday morning (9:00am-1:00pm) we will equip you to better face the technology giant and enjoy it in a safe and structured way. We will also unveil our new Resource Center and strategy for Family Ministry, as well as have some of Brain’s materials available for sale.</p>
						<p>The deadline to register is Wed., Sept. 20<sup>th</sup>. Registration includes lunch and childcare (while available). I look forward to sharing this time with you!</p>
