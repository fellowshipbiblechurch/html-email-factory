						<h4>Fellowship Family,</h4>
						<p>As you may have heard, Pine Cove’s Camp in The City is returning to the Franklin campus on June 12th-16th for kids currently in K-5th grades. This past Sunday we introduced a new ministry initiative that we’re very excited about, the “Love Your Neighbor” Fund. “Love Your Neighbor” is our designated fund that will allow us to be the hands and feet of Christ through opportunities to share the good news with families in our community. Our first initiative is toward camp scholarships for Camp in The City—to offer kids in our community to attend.</p>
						<p>We’re inviting you to join in because we believe this is a strategic opportunity for our church. Would you please prayerfully consider making a gift toward “Love Your Neighbor” as God leads you? This fund will allow kids who may have never experienced a Christian camp or event to hear the gospel---many, most likely, for the first time!</p>
						<p>You may give online by following this link: http://www.fellowshipbiblechurch.org/give/. To designate your gift to the right account, please select “Local and Global” from the drop-down box, and then “Franklin, Love Your Neighbor Fund.”</p>
						<p>Also, learn more about Pine Cove’s Camp in The City by visiting: https://www.pinecove.com/summer-camps/camp-city</p>
						<p>We love you dearly and are so thankful for you and your heart for the Lord, Fellowship, and the community of Franklin!</p>
						<p>Together with you,</p>
