						<h5>Dear Fellowship Family,</h5>
						<p>Change is never easy, but many times God brings it about to do something new that is in His time and His way. Our family of faith is experiencing such changes and we would like to share a couple with you.</p>
						<p>First, our Fellowship Kids Director, Connie Dunlop is stepping down from her role at the end of June. While Connie is not leaving Fellowship Franklin, she is focusing on spending more time with her family and the next season of God’s work in her life. Connie recently went to South Sudan with Fellowship and has developed a huge heart for child advocacy. We celebrate this as God is stirring up a new heart for this direction in her! Connie has served faithfully at Franklin for five years, and her legacy and impact will live on as Fellowship Kids continues to flourish and grow. We are grateful for her influence in the lives of our children and families and for her friendship. But we are especially excited to see how God has worked in her life and how He will use her as she prayerfully considers what’s to come.</p>
						<p>Second, Fellowship Kids will continue to grow and impact families. Emily Drake will be moving into a new role as our Fellowship Kids Director. Emily has led our elementary ministry very well, and we are excited to see how God will use her in this new position. Emily will lead our Fellowship Kids team that will also expand many of their roles and responsibilities as our family ministry continues to grow.</p>
						<p>The growth of Fellowship Kids and the caliber of staff that we have to step in and lead in their areas is a testimony to the influence and leadership that Connie has built over the last five years.</p>
						<p>We will recognize Connie during the June 25<sup>th</sup> service and we will also have a chance for you as a church family to speak into her. There will be a basket near the assisted check-in desk to collect any personal notes or encouragements that you and your family may want to write to Connie. We will provide plenty of paper, pens and envelopes for you to use; or you may want to go ahead and write a note and bring it with you. We trust this will be blessing and a meaningful way to thank Connie.</p>
						<p>Thank you for the privilege of serving alongside! We are grateful to the Lord for all that He is doing in our own lives and in the life of Fellowship Franklin, He is indeed faithful!</p>
						<p>With Gratitude,</p>
