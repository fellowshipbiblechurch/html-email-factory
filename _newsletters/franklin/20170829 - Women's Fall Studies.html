						<h5>Fellowship Franklin Women,</h5>
						<p>Last week it was amazing to see the world stop to take in the awe and wonder of the solar eclipse! It reminded me that we will gather together for special events in our lives and we will stop everything else we’re doing to be a part of the things we truly value. The amazing work and creation of our Heavenly Father through the eclipse did just that for so many of us around the country.</p>
						<p>As I think towards this year's opportunities for women to mature in the faith, I hope and pray for similar passion. I hope we take the time to gather together in community with other women to study God’s Word and spur one another in truth and love. I hope that we would also take time to stop everything else in our crazy schedules to meditate on His Word and invest in our relationship with our Heavenly Father. I hope you’ll take some time to pray and consider joining one of these studies this year:</p>
						<h4>Redemption &amp; Grace (fall &amp; spring)</h4>
						<p>This fall, on Monday mornings, come study the rich, redemptive story of Ruth and learn about God’s sovereignty, grace, and love for His people through brokenness. In the spring, we’ll discover how to live in the grace of the gospel and how to live it out through studying the Book of Ephesians. This study includes live teaching using inductive Bible study and discussing our homework in assigned small groups at round tables.</p>

						<h4>Romans For You (fall &amp; spring)</h4>
						<p>This group on Monday evenings will be studying the book <em>Romans for You</em> by Timothy Keller. We’ll dive into the Book of Romans to learn about the true meaning of the gospel and discover how it transforms our hearts and lives today.  This is a small group discussion led study meeting in a home in Franklin, TN.</p>

						<h4>Unshaken (fall)</h4>
						<p>This study on Wednesday evenings is for moms in all seasons of life. We will identify biblical principles that will help us engage the steadfast art of prayer with passion. We will be equipped to pray with boldness and consistency as we learn to entrust our family, our fears, and our future to God in alignment with His heart, His will, and His Word. This is a small group discussion led study meeting in a home in Franklin, TN.</p>
