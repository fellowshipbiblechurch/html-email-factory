						<h5>Fellowship Women,</h5>
						<p>I continue to thank God for the blessing of <em>#truthtuesday</em>. It was a beautiful summer together and I am so glad each of you could be a part. I love what Amanda Mae exhorted us with below and pray that each of you will continue to seek the Lord in His Word.</p>
						<div class="blockquote">
							<h5>Ladies,</h5>
							<p>If there’s one detail of Amy’s story I’ll never forget, it’s “cartwheel”. When she said that was the word God gave her in the midst of her anguish and wrestling with Him, I think we were all a little skeptical of where the story was going!</p>
							<p>But that was the love of God showing mercy towards His daughter whom He designed and knows so well. It was the faithfulness of a personal God revealing Himself in an undeniable way that would give Amy peace, hope, and maybe even a little joy in the midst of chaos. A cartwheel brought her to her knees because it was her and Abba’s special thing which spoke directly to her heart. <em>He stood there with her, with Abby, with the Sheehans&hellip;</em></p>
							<p>“He stood there with him” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34%3A5&version=NASB">Exodus 34:5</a>) is the verse right before our theme verse for this study. Utilizing the Bible reading skills I learned from having done several of our Women’s Studies at Fellowship, I read back a little further to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+33%3A12-23&version=NASB">Exodus 33:12-23</a> to get more context and discovered why God was revealing Himself to Moses: Moses asked Him to.</p>
							<p>Part of that process was also God giving Moses specific instructions. Moses was obedient, God was faithful to His promises, and “Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34%3A8&version=KJV">Exodus 34:8</a>)</p>
							<p>As you reflect on your own life and next steps, I encourage you to spend time in God’s Word and ask God to reveal Himself to <em>you</em>. If and when He tells you to do your own personal “cartwheel” wherever you might be, I pray you won’t hesitate&mdash;and you can expect to see His glory.</p>
							<p>Finally, we invite you to join us this fall for one of our Bible studies where we’ll open up and study God’s Word weekly. It’s a wonderful way to connect with other women and deepen your faith. Learn more about each class <a href="http://www.fellowshipbiblechurch.org/brentwood/ministries/women/">on our website</a>, or you can always <a href="mailto:ecutrer@fbctn.org">email Elisabeth Cutrer</a>.</p>
							<p>It has been an honor to be in your presence this summer.</p>
							<p>"Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen." Ephesians 3:20-21</p>
