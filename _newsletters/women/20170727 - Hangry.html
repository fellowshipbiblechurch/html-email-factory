						<h5>Dear Friends,</h5>
						<p>Do you ever get “hangry”? You know the creative term people use to describe those of us who get a bit snippy if our blood sugar gets too low. I admit that I fall into this category and it’s not pretty. If I’m feeling even slightly hungry when my husband and I are headed out to dinner, he knows we need to make a decision quickly. Otherwise, I become indecisive and cranky. One time, when the waitress didn’t bring our appetizer right away, I leaned my head over and cried. (Ridiculous, I know&mdash;especially since I have never had to experience true hunger.)</p>
						<p>I’ve heard the way to prevent low blood sugar is to eat several small meals throughout the day or snack on almonds or a piece of cheese in the afternoon. When I do this, I have noticed that it does help and I am less likely to turn into the incredible Hulk around 5:00pm.</p>
						<p>I’ve also experienced being spiritually “hangry.” When I haven’t been nourishing myself with God’s Word, I become easily angered, sensitive, impatient, even sad and afraid. Jesus is the bread of life (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A35&version=NASB">John 6:35</a>) and He “is” the Word (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A1&version=NASB">John 1:1</a>), so if I want to know Jesus, I must consume Scripture. On days when I remain in His Word by meditating, memorizing, or even taking a few minutes to read throughout the day, I am far less likely to become easily agitated, unfocused, or even unkind. Furthermore, I feel healthier, stronger, and less afraid.</p>
						<p>If you would like to be more intentional about feasting on God’s Word, I encourage you to join us for one of our Bible studies this coming fall. We have several to choose from and our studies include live teaching utilizing inductive Bible study and discussing our homework in assigned small groups at round tables.</p>
						<p>You’re invited to pull up a chair with a group of friends and enjoy a unique meal that will truly fill you up.</p>

						<p>Love,
