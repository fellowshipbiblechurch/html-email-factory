						<h5>Dear Friends,</h5>
						<p>Not too long ago, I accidentally slept through my alarm. I had set it with enough time to do my Bible study AND take a shower before needing to tackle all the other morning mom tasks&mdash;making lunches and hair-braiding for my two daughters. Now that I had overslept, I wouldn’t have time for it all. To be honest, more often than not, Bible study would be the item to get cut. But, on this particular morning, I chose to skip the shower and throw on a hat. After my minimal hygiene efforts, I glanced at the clock and knew I had about 37 minutes before my kids woke up and the craziness began. I plopped into my chair with my Bible on my lap and caught a faint whiff of the deodorant I had just layered onto dirty armpits. <em>At least it was working.</em></p>
            <p>Right after that, a litany of thoughts rushed in. <em>Had I signed my daughter’s reading log last night? What will we have for dinner? I should call my mom today. When is the PTO meeting this week? I should really make time to exercise.</em> Frustrated, I took a deep breath and attempted to focus. I closed my eyes and said a brief prayer asking for His help before opening my Bible to where I had left off in the Book of Luke a day (or two) before. This is the passage I read:</p>
            <div class="blockquote">
                <p><sup>38 </sup>Now as they were traveling along, He entered a village; and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home. <sup>39 </sup>She had a sister called Mary, who was seated at the Lord’s feet, listening to His word. <sup>40 </sup>But Martha was distracted with all her preparations; and she came up to Him and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to do all the serving alone? Then tell her to help me.” <sup>41 </sup>But the Lord answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and bothered about so many things; <sup>42 </sup>but only one thing is necessary, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.”</p>
                <h5 class="u-flush--b">Luke 10:38-42</h5>
            </div>
            <p>“Only one thing is necessary.”</p>
            <p>One thing.</p>
            <p>Time with Jesus.</p>
            <p>I laughed even as I cried. I felt as if the Lord was smoothing my (dirty) hair and filling me with His love. That morning, I had decided to sit at His feet. My physical hygiene may have been lacking that day, but my heart was glowing!</p>
            <p>I am far from perfect at being disciplined about prayer and Bible study, but remembering this incident has helped me choose time with Jesus over showering, exercise, sleep, and other household tasks time and time again.</p>
            <p>I tell you this story as an invitation to mark your calendar, and make a plan to come to one of our spring semester Bible studies. In doing so, you’ll find community and accountability with other women who also long for time with Jesus. Because we all have a million things to do, but only one thing is necessary.</p>
            <p>New studies begin Tuesday, January 16<sup>th</sup>, but you can <a href="http://www.fellowshipbiblechurch.org/brentwood/ministries/women" title="Women's Spring Semester Studies">sign up <em>TODAY</em></a>. (Wouldn’t it feel good to check something off your list?)</p>
