						<h5>Fellowship Women,</h5>
						<p>I'm loving <em>#truthtuesday</em>! It fills my heart to hear such amazing stories of God's goodness. Here is a note from Amanda Mae, our Class Administrator.</p>
						<div class="blockquote">
							<h5>Ladies,</h5>
							<p>I don’t know about you but as Philis so vulnerably shared each of the journal entries she wrote after the tragic loss of her son, I could hear the pained sighs, compassionate groans, and physically feel the weight of sadness in the room. We may not all be mothers and may not have had the same experience, but at some level we can empathize with hope, loss, disappointment, and unbearable sadness&mdash;a sadness that could possibly eat us alive unless we allow the grace of God to penetrate our hearts and sustain us.</p>
							<p>What I found remarkable and even beautiful about Philis’s story was, like David in the Psalms, she was open with God about her heart and struggles but she always came back to and rested in the <strong>truth</strong> of who God is not just once, but over&hellip; and over&hellip; and over&hellip;.</p>
							<p>Grief takes time and requires an immeasurable amount of grace. But thank God that He has an endless supply for us and in time&mdash;<em>His</em> time&mdash;we can rejoice in how He uses our stories to glorify Him, heal us, and help us to comfort those around us.</p>
							<p>When you find yourself gripped by fear or the “what ifs” that lead down a terrible road, I hope you’ll sing this refrain as a reminder to yourself:</p>
							<div style="padding-left: 28px;">
								<h6 class="u-flush--b">“Turn your eyes upon Jesus,</h6>
								<h6 class="u-flush--b">Look full in His wonderful face;</h6>
								<h6 class="u-flush--b">And the things of earth will grow strangely dim</h6>
								<h6>In the light of His glory and grace.”</h6>
							</div>
							<p>May God have mercy and compassion on you this week. See you next Tuesday, July 18<sup>th</sup>, for our last class.</p>
							<p class="u-flush">Love,</p>
