						<h5>Fellowship Women,</h5>
						<p>I’ll never forget when I first moved to Nashville, Amy Grant held the door open for my daughter and I as we exited a dance class in Green Hills. We’ve chatted with Brandon Heath at Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams and worked with several famous songwriters on middle school events at my daughter’s school.</p>
						<p>This is Music City after all and we are surrounded by talent!</p>
						<p>Fellowship Women would like to celebrate the gifted female singer/songwriters right here in our church body. We hope you’ll come enjoy this songwriters experience and take time for a night out with friends.</p>
