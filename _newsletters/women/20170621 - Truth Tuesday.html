						<h5>Fellowship Women,</h5>
						<p>I hope you're enjoying #truthtuesday as much as I am! Here are some encouraging words for this week from Amanda Mae, our Class Administrator.</p>
						<div class="blockquote">
							<h5>Ladies,</h5>
							<p>I think it’s safe to say we can all relate to Allyson’s story; the details of our personal stories may look different but the feelings of shame, unworthiness, and not being “good enough” are universal experiences which the enemy desires for us to be stuck in.</p>
							<p>But when we realize the truth that God is not angry with us and that He longs to be gracious to us, we have the courage to draw near to His throne of grace. When we allow His amazing love and grace to penetrate our hearts, we see our brokenness in a new light that empowers us to share our stories as Allyson did, bringing Him glory and encouraging others in their own journey.</p>
							<p>As we worshiped last night there was one particular lyric that really stood out to me:</p>
							<h6><em><span class="u-text--base">My sin, </span>not in part but the whole,
							<br><span class="u-text--base">Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more&hellip;</span></em></h6>
							<p>This week, ask the Lord to reveal any areas of your life where you feel God is angry with you, then leave it, ALL of it&mdash;at the cross.</p>
							<h6><em>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!</em></h6>
							<p class="u-flush">Love,</p>
