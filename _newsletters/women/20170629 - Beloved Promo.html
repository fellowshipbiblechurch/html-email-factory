						<h5>Dear Friends,</h5>
						<p>When I was in third grade, I told the entire class that my family had a limousine with a chauffeur and everything. This was a big, fat falsehood and some kids accused me of lying. But I insisted that my mom would pick me up <em>that day</em> in the limo. “Wow!” Some kids said. “That’s so cool,” someone murmured.</p>
						<p>At pick-up time, everyone craned their necks with anticipation looking around for a big, stretch limousine. I even stood on my tiptoes looking for a limo and trying to will my limo-lie into existence. Instead, I climbed, red-faced into my mom’s 1980 Toyota Cressida amidst the jeers and scoffs of my classmates.</p>
						<p>Why did I lie like that? I think it was because my family was broken. My parents were in the midst of a nasty divorce and I probably needed a diversion from that unhappy reality. When my classmates thought I was rich, I felt valuable, popular, and important&mdash;maybe even loved.</p>
						<p>Eventually, I got brave enough to tell people the truth about the less-than-perfect things that were happening in my life and the response to my confessions were often “me too” or “I feel the same way!” Over the years, I found that being authentic resulted in more true friendships than acting like I was perfect or rich.</p>
						<p>We all tend to hide our brokenness, but the more I understand the depth of God’s love for me in Christ, the less I feel the need to fake it or act like everything is fine all the time.</p>
						<p>If you feel like everyone else has it all together, or if you hate feeling imperfect, or if you’d like to know love without conditions, please mark your calendars for Tuesday, August 1<sup>st</sup>, at 6:00pm and come experience a unique women’s event filled with authentic stories of being loved in our brokenness.</p>
						<p>I invite you to (Be)loved.</p>
