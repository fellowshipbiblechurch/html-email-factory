						<h5>Fellowship Women,</h5>
						<p>A friend of ours recently spent eight days away from his two young children and pregnant wife on the other side of the world. Upon his return, his wife and children were waiting, not-so patiently, just outside the airport security.</p>
						<p>When their daddy came down that hallway, his wife snapped a photo of the backs of two tiny kids blurred in their run towards the one they’d been waiting for. In the picture, you can see the face of their father: eyes fixed on his two beloved children, a look of utter joy shining from his face.</p>
						<p>That is a picture of what we have to look forward to: being reunited with the lover of our souls.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Reunion, like the one described above, is one type of “encounter.”</li>
							<li>Introduction is another. I am a fan of “love-at-first-sight” introductions in movies: when two people are introduced and they instantly connect.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>I hope you know Jesus personally and find comfort that one day you will be reunited with Him. But, are there other ways we can encounter God now? I’d like to invite you to an event that exquisitely portrays what happens when we encounter Jesus and bring Him our deepest needs.</p>
						<p>Fellowship Women, Fellowship Student Ministries (FSM) and Fellowship School of Dance invite you to a one-night only viewing of the stunning ballet The Encounter--created by our very own Mary Cadle, Fellowship School of Dance Director. We’ll then separate into small groups and discuss themes covered in the ballet.</p>
						<p>YOU are invited! Along with all 7th-12th grade girls. This exciting, multi-generational event is Beautiful Encounters. Mark your calendars and plan to attend this night of wonder and conversation.</p>
						<p>Hope to see you soon!</p>
